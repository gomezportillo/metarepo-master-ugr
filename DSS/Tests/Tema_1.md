# Respuestas a los tests del Tema 1 de DSS

**About open software systems components characterization: choose the incorrect answer**

- [x] They are object-oriented systems.

**Differences between design patterns and frameworks for component based software development choose the correct answer**

- [x] A framework is a set of classes that can be modified to be adapted to the specific requirements of a software application.

**Which one of the following characteristics does not belong to a software component:**

- [x] It is a polymorphic software entity that reacts differently when deployed in different execution environments or contexts.

**Which one of the following characteristics does not belong to a software component:**

- [x] It is a polymorphic software entity that reacts differently when deployed in different execution environments or contexts.

**Explain why a software component, which can have an internal structure (made up of multiple objects, classes, etc.) cannot deploy only a part of its structure, but otherwise a component must be deployed as 1 unit only.**

> Because a software component can only work properly by being fully deployed, as it needs to be able to access to its complete functionality. Thus, doing it partially would not lead to anything working.

**Select the only incorrect answer regarding component interface specification:**

- [x] The concrete specification of software component dependencies will only depend on the component model that a specific framework uses.

**Select the only incorrect answer regarding models of software components:**

- [x] Every component framework has to be only based on a specific model of components.
